Understanding Graph Theory:

    Gain a foundational understanding of graph theory concepts, including vertices, edges, and weighted graphs.
    Learn about different types of spanning trees and their properties.

Kruskal's Algorithm:

    Comprehend the steps and logic behind Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree.
    Analyze how the algorithm leverages sorting and union-find data structures to efficiently construct the MST.

Data Structures:

    Familiarize oneself with essential data structures such as lists, arrays, and the union-find structure, including path compression and union by rank techniques.

Algorithm Implementation:

    Develop skills in implementing algorithms programmatically in a chosen programming language (e.g., Python).
    Enhance debugging and problem-solving skills by resolving issues that arise during the implementation.

Graph Representation:

    Learn different ways to represent graphs in code, particularly edge lists and adjacency lists, and understand their respective advantages and disadvantages.

GUI Development:

    Acquire knowledge in developing user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using libraries such as Tkinter.
    Understand event-driven programming concepts and how to handle user inputs effectively.
